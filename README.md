## Overview

This repository contains my work on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas library. The project focuses on analyzing a dataset to uncover insights, visualize relationships, and prepare data for further analysis or modeling.
In this project, I explore a dataset to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies. The analysis is performed using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the data and its potential implications.
